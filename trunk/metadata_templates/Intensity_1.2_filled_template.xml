   <abstract>Product: Phelps and Dent county, Missouri 2014 Lidar Intensity Imagery.
   	Geographic Extent: Phelps and Dent county, Missouri, covering approximately 1,500 square miles. Dataset Description: Phelps and Dent county, Missouri 2014 Lidar project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meter. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83, Universal Transverse Mercator, meters and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12A), meters. Lidar data was delivered as flightline-extent unclassified LAS swaths, as processed Classified LAS 1.4 files, formatted to 1565 individual 1500 m x 1500 m tiles, as tiled Intensity Imagery, and as tiled bare earth DEMs; all tiled to the same 1500 m x 1500 m schema. 
   	Ground Conditions: Lidar was collected in late 2014 and early 2015, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, F.L.W. Mapping, Inc. established a total of 50 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the Phelps and Dent county, Missouri project area. An additional 120 independent accuracy checkpoints, 67 in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (67 NVA points), 53 in Tall Grass and Brushland/Low Trees categories (53 VVA points), were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.</abstract>
   <!-- Abstract - a brief narrative descriptive summary of the data set. Type: text. Domain: free text. -->
 <purpose>To acquire detailed surface elevation data for use in conservation planning, design, research, floodplain mapping, dam safety assessments and elevation modeling, etc. Classified LAS files are used to show the manually reviewed bare earth surface. This allows the user to create Intensity Images, Breaklines and Raster DEM. The purpose of these lidar data was to produce high accuracy 3D hydro-flattened Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with a 1 meter cell size. These raw lidar point cloud data were used to create classified lidar LAS files, intensity images, 3D breaklines, hydro-flattened DEMs as necessary.</purpose>
