      <abstract>USGS Task Order NM_NRCS_Central_2017_D18 (USGS Task Order Number 140G0218F0026). The New Mexico USDA-NRCS requires a high-resolution data set of lidar for four (4) distinct Areas of Interest (AOIs) totaling approximately 9,697 square miles located in New Mexico. The four AOIs are identified as Middle Rio Grande East, NM Upper Pecos, Arroyo Chico, and Rio Salado. This project will support the 3DEP mission and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The lidar data was acquired and processed in compliance with U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Lidar Base Specification version 1.2. This task required the lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.71 meters (QL2). The data was delivered in NAD 1983(2011) UTM Zone 13N, NAVD88 Geoid12B, meters. Final products include: LAS Swath data ASPRS 1.4, classified LAS tiles ASPRS 1.4, bare-earth DEM raster tiles (32-bit) in Erdas IMG format, Intensity raster tiles (8-bit) in GeoTiff format and hydro-flattened breaklines in ESRI format. Tiled deliverable products conform to 1,500m x 1,500m tiling scheme. Project level FGDC compliant metadata for all products except Raw Swath las data by lift.</abstract>

      <purpose>The New Mexico USDA-NRCS requires a high-resolution data set of lidar for four (4) distinct Areas of Interest (AOIs) totaling approximately 9,697 square miles located in New Mexico. The four AOIs are identified as Middle Rio Grande East (3,092 square miles), NM Upper Pecos (4,205 square miles), Arroyo Chico (1,207 square miules), and Rio Salado (1,193 square miles). This project will support the 3DEP mission and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).</purpose>

Lidar data was collected using Optech Galaxy sensor.  The raw data was verified in MARS software for complete coverage of the project area, and boresighted to align the flightlines.  Raw data files were parsed into manageable client-specific tiles.  These tiles were then processed through automated filtering that separates the data into different classification groups: unclassified points, ground points, low noise, water, ignored ground, bridge decks and high noise.  The data was next taken into MARS to reclassify the erroneous points that may remain in the lidar point cloud after auto filter. Two points per square meter (QL2).</procdesc>
