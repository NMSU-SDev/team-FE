      <abstract>Hydro-flattened breaklines were compiled and followed the Quality Level Two (QL2) standards as outlined in the USGS-NGP Lidar Base Specifications, Techniques and Methods 11-B4, Version 1.2, November 2014 (TM11-B4). Rivers greater than 100 feet wide and waterbodies larger than 2 square acres.</abstract>
      <!-- Abstract - a brief narrative descriptive summary of the data set. Type: text. Domain: free text. -->
      <purpose>The New Mexico USDA-NRCS requires a high-resolution data set of lidar for four (4) distinct Areas of Interest (AOIs) totaling approximately 9,697 square miles located in New Mexico. The four AOIs are identified as Middle Rio Grande East (3,092 square miles), NM Upper Pecos (4,205 square miles), Arroyo Chico (1,207 square miules), and Rio Salado (1,193 square miles). This project will support the 3DEP mission and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).</purpose>

  <dataqual>
    <logic>Data covers the entire area specified for this project. Hydro breaklines were collected in all inland ponds and lakes ~2 acres or greater. These features were flat and level water bodies at a single elevation for each vertex along the bank. The entire water surface edge is at or below the immediate surrounding terrain. Breaklines were collected for all streams and rivers ~100' nominal width or wider. These features are flat and level bank to bank, gradient will follow the surrounding terrain and the water surface will be at or below the surrounding terrain. Streams/river channels will break at culvert locations however not at elevated bridge locations. Depending on the situation some under bridge breaklines might be necessary so that water flows underneath these bridge locations.</logic>
    <complete>The dataset was reviewed to ensure completeness and accuracy.</complete>

        <!-- Process Step - information about a single processing step. Type: compound. -->
        <procdesc>Using MARS software hydro-flattened breaklines (rivers greater than 100 feet wide and waterbodies greater than two square acres) were compiled. Some bridges could potentially need breaklines placed under them so that water will flow properly. Using intensity values and 3d elevations generates ESRI shape files which are then imported into an ESRI gdb for a project-wide delivery. Monotonicity checks where validated (water flowing downstream).</procdesc>
