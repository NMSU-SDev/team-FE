      <abstract>A one-meter (1m) cell size Digital Elevation Model (DEM) raster was created from the ground classified lidar points plus the breaklines. The files are delivered in tile format (1500m by 1500m), The rasters are delivered in ERDAS .img format.</abstract>
      <!-- Abstract - a brief narrative descriptive summary of the data set. Type: text. Domain: free text. -->
      <purpose>The New Mexico USDA-NRCS requires a high-resolution data set of lidar for four (4) distinct Areas of Interest (AOIs) totaling approximately 9,697 square miles located in New Mexico. The four AOIs are identified as Middle Rio Grande East (3,092 square miles), NM Upper Pecos (4,205 square miles), Arroyo Chico (1,207 square miules), and Rio Salado (1,193 square miles). This project will support the 3DEP mission and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).</purpose>
