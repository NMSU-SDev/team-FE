Answer: To acquire detailed surface elevation data for use in conservation planning, design, research, floodplain mapping, dam safety assessments and elevation modeling, etc. Classified LAS files are used to show the manually reviewed bare earth surface. This allows the user to create Intensity Images, Breaklines and Raster DEM. The purpose of these lidar data was to produce high accuracy 3D hydro-flattened Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with a 1 meter cell size. These raw lidar point cloud data were used to create classified lidar LAS files, intensity images, 3D breaklines, and hydro-flattened DEMs as necessary. Verified: N

****procdesc  ElementName:  Process Description  Question:  an explanation of the the processing step and parameters used. Include Flight, Imagery development, Analysis. Type: text. Domain: free text Answer: Hydro Flattening Breakline Processing: Class 2 (ground) lidar points was used to create a bare earth surface model. The surface model was then used to heads-up digitize 2D breaklines of inland streams and rivers with a 100 foot nominal width and Inland Ponds and Lakes of 2 acres or greater surface area. Elevation values were assigned to all Inland Ponds and Lakes, Inland Pond and Lake Islands, Inland Stream and River Islands, using TerraModeler functionality. Elevation values were assigned to all Inland streams and rivers using F.L.W. Mapping, Inc proprietary software. All ground (ASPRS Class 2) lidar data inside of the collected inland breaklines were then classified to water (ASPRS Class 9) using TerraScan macro functionality. A buffer of 3 feet was also used around each hydro-flattened feature. These points were moved from ground (ASPRS Class 2) to Ignored Ground (ASPRS Class 10). The breakline files were then translated to ESRI File-Geodatabase format using ESRI conversion tools. Breaklines are reviewed against lidar intensity imagery to verify completeness of capture. All breaklines are then compared to TINs (triangular irregular networks) created from ground only points prior to water classification. The horizontal placement of breaklines is compared to terrain features and the breakline elevations are compared to lidar elevations to ensure all breaklines match the lidar within acceptable tolerances. Some deviation is expected between breakline and lidar elevations due to monotonicity, connectivity, and flattening rules that are enforced on the breaklines. Once completeness, horizontal placement, and vertical variance is reviewed, all breaklines are reviewed for topological consistency and data integrity using a combination of ESRI Data Reviewer tools and proprietary tools.
